			<p class="bodycopy1">After being in medicine for 20 years, I felt it was time for a major change. So here I am 44 years old and trying to figure
				out what I want to be when I grow up. Medicine has shown me many wonderul,questionable and terrible situations.</p>
				
				<br>

				<br>

				<br>
				
	
			<p class="bodycopy2">Now that medicine has turned into a business, the need to truly help others has completely turned into a financial competition. 
            In my early career I had the opportunity to travel and see many beautiful places in the United States.My favorite place of all was Alaska by far, 
			I loved it so much that when I reached the end of my travel career I moved to Fairbanks, Alaska for about 10 years, I loved every minute of it.</p>
